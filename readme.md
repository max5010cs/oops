## 🤔 What is oops?

`oops` is a terminal-based code security tool built to help you **catch issues before they become f*ckups**.

It can do:

- ✅ Pre-deployment scans (`oops run .`)
- 👀 Live real-time monitoring (`oops watch .`)
- 😅 Injects funny reminders when you're about to mess up

What it looks for:

- 🔐 Hardcoded secrets & credentials
- ☣️ Dangerous patterns (e.g. `eval`, unsafe functions)
- ⚙️ Misconfigurations (e.g. debug mode on)
- 🔓 Over-permissive access/permissions
- 🤡 Common bad practices
- 🧠 Known vulnerable code patterns

It's lightweight, fast, terminal-native, and works on any project.  
You write — it watches. You commit — it warns. That's it.
